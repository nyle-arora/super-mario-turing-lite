Welcome to Super Mario Bros Turing Lite! In this game, you will be locked in a deadly clash against the notorious King 
Koopa, Bowser, at his villainous lair. This is the fight of your life as you go up against Bowser to fight for the 
eradication of all humanoid turtles.  

To control the Mario avatar, you will use the arrow keys to direct Mario's movement. Pressing the right arrow
will make Mario move backwards, pressing the left arrow will make Mario move backwards, and pressing the up arrow will
make Mario jump. Pressing the right arrow and the up arrow at the same time will make Mario jump forward, while pressing
the left arrow and the up arrow at the same time will make Mario jump backwards. 

While you may be able to move fast, Bowser is ready to give you a good fight, as he'll move across the bridge himself and 
send obstacles your way. To win this mortal combat, you must navigate Mario through Bowser's various attacks and avoid 
touching Bowser himself. If you touch Bowser or his weapons, you die and there is an instant game over. To defeat Bowser,
you have to cross the bridge and jump on the axe, which will cut the chain holding the bridge up, sending Bowser 
plummeting to a gruesome, graphic demise. If you fail to do so, Bowser will emerge victorious in this battle, and humanoid
turtles will gain rights and bring democracy to the Mushroom Kingdom. This is unacceptable. 

You'll have the chance to prove your worth against Bowser again and again, and each time, he's more and more dangerous!
In the first level, Bowser will move around the bridge to catch you before you reach the axe. In the second level, Bowser
will gain firepower and send fire your way to burn the mustache of Mario's face. It's not going to be easy, but it's your 
responsibility to defeat Bowser and stamp on the rights of humanoid turtles everywhere! Good luck!
